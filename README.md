# Froeling Lambdatronic Modbus
Home Assistant integration for Fröling Lambdatronic heating systems via Modbus (currently supports Modbus TCP only).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
> **This integration is experimental and has not been tested over long periods.**  
> It may contain missing or incorrect sensor data.

## 🚀 Features
With this integration, you can:
- Read real-time sensor data from your Fröling heating system.
- Monitor boiler performance and operational parameters.
- Configure heating system settings directly from Home Assistant.

## 💻 Requirements
To communicate with the heating system, you need a Modbus-to-TCP device.  
This integration has been tested with the **Waveshare RS232/RS485 to Ethernet Converter**, but other Serial-to-Ethernet adapters should work.

### 🔧 Enabling Modbus RTU on the Boiler
To enable Modbus RTU on your Fröling boiler:

1. Navigate to **Boiler Settings**.
2. Click the user icon and enter code `-7`.
3. Adjust the following settings:  
    - **Settings > General Settings > MODBUS Settings > Modbus Protokoll RTU** → `Set to 1`  
    - **Settings > General Settings > MODBUS Settings > Use Modbus Protokoll 2014** → `Yes`  
    - **Settings > General Settings > MODBUS Settings > Use COM2 as MODBUS Interface** → `Yes`

## 🛠️ Hardware Setup
I used a [Waveshare RS232/RS485 to Ethernet Converter](https://www.waveshare.com/rs232-485-to-eth.htm) and connected **RS232 to COM2** on the boiler.

Other Serial-to-Ethernet converters should work as well.
